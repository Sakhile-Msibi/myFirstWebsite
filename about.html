                <p>
                    My name is Sakhile Msibi and I am a Software Developer. I have created this website to share a portfolio of my projects and write blog posts
                    about software development topics that I think are useful to anyone interested in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first started programming when I was doing physics simulations during my undergraduate studies. I decided to learn programming full-time
                    after I struggled to do Monte-Carlo simulations for my MSc in Medical Physics research. Since then I have learned to program in C, JavaScript,
                    Python and Java, with JavaScript being the main language I now use for programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to become a full-stack developer. My definition of a full-stack developer is a developer who is comfortable working as a
                    front-end, back-end, DevOps and design. I have done web projects that uses JavaScript, NodeJS and MySQL, they can be found on my GitHub page.
                    When I was an intern in a software development company we used ELK stack (Elasticsearch) to create a dashboard to monitor performance of 
                    AWS EC2 instances. We also develop a web application that was stored and deployed using Azure. I am also excited about Machine Learning and 
                    Quantum computing, because these technology has a potential to improve how we do things in various field, such as communication and finance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I keep my skills sharp by by reading software development related books. I have just finished reading a book called
                    "The complete software developer's career guide" by John Sonmez and I have started reading a book called "Eloquent JavaScript" by
                    Marijn Haverbeke to solidify by understanding of JavaScript. I read freecodecamp newsletter to try and keep my software skills sharp.
                    I also keep my software development skills sharp by doing hackathons. Currently I am a team lead of a team which has join the Atos 2021 IT challenge.
                    Where we intend to develop an application that will help in decarbonisation. We have decided to come up with a idea of a application that
                    will help farmers know the amount of carbon dioxide they are emitting and help them to reduce it by modelling various crop management practises.
                    In my spare time I create software application that I find interesting, like this website and some of the projects in my portfolio.
